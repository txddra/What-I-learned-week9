### This week in Code Immersives lore...

#### a plethora  of new concepts, to include :

- **[Node.js as a File Server](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_filesystem.asp)**

  - The *Node.js file system module* allows you to work with the file system on your computer.

  - To include the File System module, use the require() method:
  
    ``const fs = require('fs')``


- **['Throw'](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_throw.asp)**
  
  -  The *throw statement* throws (generates) an error.

  - When an error occurs, JavaScript will normally stop, and generate an error message.

  - The technical term for this is: JavaScript will throw an error.

  - The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.

  - The technical term for this is: throw an exception.

The exception can be a JavaScript String, a Number, a Boolean or an Object:

``throw "Too big";    // throw a text
throw 500;          // throw a number``
